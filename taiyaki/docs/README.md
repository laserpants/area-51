## Language implementation

## Compilation strategy

The compiler proceeds through a series of transformations applied to the syntax
tree, the final goal of which is to arrive at a form suitable for code
generation or evaluation.

### Patterns

#### Exhaustiveness checking

#### Compilation

## Etymology
